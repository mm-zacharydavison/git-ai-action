The problem is that the `git-ai ci github run` command clones the repository, does its work, and then likely cleans up after itself by removing the clone. By the time the next step runs, the `git-ai-ci-clone` directory no longer exists.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n\n1. **Line 66**: `git-ai ci github run` clones the repo to `git-ai-ci-clone` and processes it\n2. The logs show: \"Working repository is in `/home/runner/work/testing-gitflows-git-ai/testing-gitflows-git-ai/git-ai-ci-clone/.git`\"\n3. After `git-ai ci github run` completes, it cleans up the clone\n4. **Line 70**: The next step tries to use `working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}/git-ai-ci-clone/.git` but the directory no longer exists\n\n## Solutions:\n\n**Option 1: Uncomment the checkout step and don't rely on git-ai's clone**",
